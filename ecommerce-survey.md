# Ecommerce Survey


For the last four years I built an eCommerce survey.  It takes a list of sites, e.g. the [Alexa Top 1 Million](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and then a spider visits the homepage of every site.  It passes the HTML page through a detection engine built up of signatures that recognise various ecommerce platforms.

## In the media

I am very grateful for the coverage that the results and analyses have received in conferences and the media. 

Coverage includes:

- [Magento](http://magento.com/blog/magento-news/magento-leading-ecommerce-platform-alexas-top-1m-sites#.U0l7Na2iBYg)
- [Yahoo! Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/magento-delivers-strong-momentum-key-070100656.html)
- [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130410-911828.html)
- [Practical Ecommerce](http://www.practicalecommerce.com/columns/open-source-ecommerce/10999-Biggest-eCommerce-Gainers-and-Losers-in-World-s-Top-1-Million-Websites)

## Data for purchase

Please get in touch if you would be interested in purchasing a dataset. 

I can also perform custom surveys tailored to your needs.  For example, this could incldue running the technology survey over a different pre-filtered list of sites provided by a third party.  For a product company or service provider, this is a great way of finding out what your customers are running. 

## Broadening the survey

Over the last year, we have been reinventing the survey again.  This has included testing out different technologies and different detection methodologies.  More information to be released in the coming months.
