I thought I'd share with you a band that I've been following for the last couple of months.  Since I was introduced, I have not been able to stop listening to them.

Here's "Indie Sweat" for you to listen to, I assure you, you'll want to listen to it more than once.

<a href="http://www.myspace.com/icallshotguntheband">I Call Shotgun</a> are from Leeds and currently unsigned, but as their popularity shoots e.g. on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-Call-Shotgun/11292781207">facebook.com</a>, they are attracting major label interest. I predict that it won't be long before you'll be seeing them with some major gigs with their "heavy synth, dirty bass and catchy riffs".

So get following them.
