During this month's <a href="2011/02/magento-extends-lead-in-ecommerce-survey-february-2011/">eCommerce survey</a> which found Magento as the most popular eCommerce software, I added some one-off signatures to look for use of HTML5 in the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa top 1 million</a> sites.   In total, I found <strong>36,080 sites that were using features of HTML5.</strong>

33,813 sites were using the new doctype.  While this may seem like a lot, it is only 3.4% of the top million sites according to Alexa.

14,125 sites were using elements new to HTML5, these can be identified on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp">w3schools</a>.  

1,769 were using Remy Sharp's <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">HTML5 enabling script</a> which can be found hosted on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/">Google Code</a>.

I thought about making this post another one along the lines of "Why you should be using HTML5 now", but I realised that wasn't necessary, there are enough of those around already.  Hence, I've just given you the figures so that you can draw your own conclusions.
