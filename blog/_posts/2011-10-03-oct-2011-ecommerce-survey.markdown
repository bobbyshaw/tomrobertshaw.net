October 2011's eCommerce survey found 4% more stores than the <a href="http://tomrobertshaw.net/2011/06/june-2011-ecommerce-survey/">June survey</a>, detecting 26,594 in total.  The analysis looks at the home page of the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">top 1 million Alexa sites</a> and analyses them for identifying features of 32 different eCommerce packages.  

Both Zen Cart and Magento see huge growths of 18% each this month.  However, Magento is the real winner with over 20% of the eCommerce sites found being attributed to the platform.  We've consistently seen growth from Magento over the last 12 months and it shows no sign of slowing.

Meanwhile, osCommerce remains the 4th most popular platform but the downward trend continues with 200 less sites compared June's survey.

There are a number of other eCommerce platforms that have seen steady growth over the last 12 months, including Interspire, OpenCart, PrestaShop and Uber-cart.

The presence of Enterprise edition of Magento has increased from 274 to 378 sites, up by over a third!  As a biased Magento Developer, it is very encouraging to see more and more corporate companies moving to the platform.

As an aside, the hosting location of each site was checked.  Of the twenty-six thousand sites, over ten thousand were hosted in the United States.  The second largest identifiable hosting country was Germany with just under two thousand sites.

This month, I decided to also look at just the top 100,000 sites to see how the distribution changes.  I was expecting software such as IBM WebSphere and GSI commerce to rule the Enterprise market.  Magento actually does very well there with 232 stores, and only 45 of which appear to be built upon the Professional/Enterprise edition.

All of the signatures remained the same this month, but I did fix one bug that had resulted in some false positives.  This causing an anomaly which is particularly noticeable with IBM WebSphere, Miva Merchant and ProStores all losing a number of stores in this edition of the survey.

### Would you be interested in purchasing a site list?

After discussions with Alexa, I've been able to confirm that it's not against their terms of service to sell lists of sites running particular eCommerce software.  So, if you're interested in getting a full or partial site list.  Please <a href="mailto:me@tomrobertshaw.net">get in touch</a>.
