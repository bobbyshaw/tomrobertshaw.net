  content: I'm surprised by those figures, I figured it'd be more widespread than
    that by now.  I might expect slow adoption in the top 1000, but there are a lot
    of smaller companies and web 2.0 app style sites in the top 1m.

  content: As an aside, I noticed you linked to w3schools, which a number of people
    have found to be a troublesome resource. See http://w3fools.com/

  content: ! "Hi Steve.  Yes, I've seen w3fools.  Unfortunately, it's the best page
    that I could find through a quick google search that succinctly indicated all
    of the new elements.  Cheers though, people should have a read of http://w3fools.com
    if they haven't seen it.  As always, no resource on the internet should be treated
    as gospel!\r\n\r\nI was surprised as well Adam.  I was hoping for a better turn
    out than that!"

During this month's <a href="2011/02/magento-extends-lead-in-ecommerce-survey-february-2011/">eCommerce survey</a> which found Magento as the most popular eCommerce software, I added some one-off signatures to look for use of HTML5 in the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa top 1 million</a> sites.   In total, I found <strong>36,080 sites that were using features of HTML5.</strong>

33,813 sites were using the new doctype.  While this may seem like a lot, it is only 3.4% of the top million sites according to Alexa.

<pre lang="text">
<!DOCTYPE html>
</pre>

14,125 sites were using elements new to HTML5, these can be identified on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_reference.asp">w3schools</a>.  

1,769 were using Remy Sharp's <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">HTML5 enabling script</a> which can be found hosted on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/">Google Code</a>.

<pre lang="html4strict">
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
</pre>

I thought about making this post another one along the lines of "Why you should be using HTML5 now", but I realised that wasn't necessary, there are enough of those around already.  Hence, I've just given you the figures so that you can draw your own conclusions.
