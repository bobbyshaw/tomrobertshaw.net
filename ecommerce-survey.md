# Ecommerce Survey


In 2010 I created the first version of the eCommerce survey.  It takes a list of sites, e.g. the [Alexa Top 1 Million](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) and then a spider visits the homepage of every site.  It passes the HTML page through a detection engine built up of signatures that recognise various ecommerce platforms.

## In the media

I am very grateful for the coverage that the results and analyses have received in conferences and the media.

Coverage includes:
