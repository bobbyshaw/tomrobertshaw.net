As my recent posts have hinted at, I have been working to import a client's products into their new Magento store.

Getting product information in to the correct spreadsheet format is time consuming enough.   Then, you come to import and find you have completed a column wrong, or forgotten to put the <a href="/2010/08/having-trouble-importing-product-images-into-magento/">leading slash</a> in front of the image file names and find you need to run the import profile all over again!

In the downtime on Friday while 270 products were being imported with the help of <a href="/2010/08/review-magento-bulk-product-import-module/">a useful module</a>, I edited <a href="http://xkcd.com/303/">this xkcd comic</a>.   

Let a nerd have his fun....
