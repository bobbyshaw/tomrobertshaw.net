title: Show Magento Module Download Stats on Geckoboard
categories:

I've been playing with <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a> in my spare time (of which I seem to have very little of at the moment).  <a href="2011/01/codebase-integration-with-geckoboard">Previously I looked at</a> displaying commit statistics from the code management tool we use, <a href="http://www.codebasehq.com/t/w1xzietlf7bit8qd/">Codebase</a>.  So next up, I thought that being able to show the number of downloads that <a href="http://www.meanbee.com">Meanbee's</a> Magento Community modules had had would be neat.

So I threw a little script together which you can get on <b><a href="https://github.com/bobbyshaw/magento-module-downloads-geckoboard">github</a></b> to do just that.  Simply specify the ID of the module (e.g. 480 for Meanbee's <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/Meanbee/extension/480/royalmail-shipping-options">Royal Mail module</a>), and paste the url in to your geckoboard widget and voil√°.  First off it will just show the number of downloads, then after a week of collecting statistics, the widget will also display the percentage increase over the last week.

<a href="http://geckoboard.zendesk.com/entries/296250-how-to-magento-ecommerce-widgets-v1-0">Geckoboard released</a> some code back in November to display information about Magento Stores using the API.   While it is in the early stages of development, it's worth a look.

If you haven't played with Geckoboard yet, I'd thoroughly recommend signing up and awaiting a beta invite.  See some dashboards in action on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=40199&id=153177308049200">Geckoboard Facebook page</a>.
