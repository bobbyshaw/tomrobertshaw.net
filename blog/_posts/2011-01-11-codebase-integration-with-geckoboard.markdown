<a href="http://geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a> is an awesome little web app which allows you to show real-time statistics about your business on a screen in the office, or anywhere for that matter!

At <a href="http://www.meanbee.com/">Meanbee</a>, we have started creating our own Geckoboard, but there are a limited number of widgets available as it is still in Beta.   We use <a href="http://www.codebasehq.com/t/w1xzietlf7bit8qd">Codebase</a> to manage our projects, so I decided to write a script to create a feed of recent commit statistics.  In its current form it can produce nifty little bars to show the top committers on a project or across the entire company.

The project is hosted on <b><a href="https://github.com/bobbyshaw/codebase-geckoboard/">github</a></b>, so you're more than welcome to take a look/fork/etc.
