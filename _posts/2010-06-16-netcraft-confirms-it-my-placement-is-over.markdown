I have come to the end of my year in industry at <a href="http://www.netcraft.com">Netcraft</a>.  I had some good times, I had some bad times. I had some exciting times, I had some frustrating times.  All in all, a year well spent and a huge amount learnt.

My most significant technical project was working with Netcraft's Top 1 Million Busiest Sites list to produce a <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/busiest-sites-switching-analysis/">switching spreadsheet</a>.  This not only allows you to see which Hosting companies have lost and gained, but also the sites that have moved.

Since leaving I have taken a well-earned rest and begin working on Meanbee full-time on Monday!  We have lots of projects planned, very exciting times ahead.

Watch <a href="http://www.meanbee.com">this</a> space.
