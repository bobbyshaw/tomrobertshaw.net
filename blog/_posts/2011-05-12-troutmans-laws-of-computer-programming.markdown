Everyone loves a list of funny computer programming jokes.  I found this email in the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/comp-sci/">Computer Science</a> department of the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a>.

<ol>
     <li>Any running program is obsolete.</li>
     <li>Any planned program costs more and takes longer.</li>
     <li>Any useful program will have to be changed.</li>
     <li>Any useless program will have to be documented.</li>
     <li>The size of a program expands to fill all available memory.</li>
     <li>The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its output.</li>
     <li>The complexity of a program grows until it exceeds the capability of the maintainers.</li>
     <li>Information necessitating a change in design is always conveyed to the implementors after the code is written.  Corollary: Given a simple choice between one obviously right way and one obviously wrong way, it is often wiser to choose the wrong way, so as to expedite subsequent revision.</li>
    <li>The more innocuous a modification appears, the more code it will require writing.</li>
    <li>If a test installation functions perfectly, all subsequent systems will malfunction.</li>
    <li>Not until a program has been in production for at least six months will the most harmful error be discovered.</li>
    <li>Interchangeable modules won't.</li>
    <li>Any system that relies on computer reliability is unreliable.</li>
    <li>Any system that relies on human reliability is unreliable.</li>
    <li>Investment in reliability increases until it exceeds the probable cost of errors, or until someone insists on getting some useful work done.</li>
    <li>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</li>
    <li>There's always one more bug.</li>
</ol>

31 years doesn't seem to change much.  Any ideas as to who Troutman might be?
